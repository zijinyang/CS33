# Separation of Hardware and Software

**ISA** - Instruction Set Architecture

* Interacts with **memory**
  * Memory involves values and instructions
* **von Neuman Execution**
  * Instructions are executed sequentially
  * branch instruction

* Software Interactions  
  * Code - compiler -> binary code - object dump -> assembly
